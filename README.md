# Kainos Insights Chrome Extension

Kainos runs insight events, which are found on their website, but its always a hassle to navigate to their website to check if new insight events are up.

This chrome extension shows new Kainos events at a single click and gives further links to view the event details on kainos' website.

This extension calls a serverless backend API at https://ki.api.janiru.dev/ calling a POST request to /api/insights, where an Authorization Bearer token must be passed into the header

##POST API Call:
